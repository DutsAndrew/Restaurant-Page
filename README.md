<strong>What I Learned:</strong>

This was a project to practice and demonstrate my ability to use and work with Webpack within JavaScript. 
    
Webpack was quite an adjustment and took some time, but getting comfortable with importing/exporting functions and designating different css and js files for compartmentalized programming made building this project a lot easier. 
    
I noticed with my last project (Tic-Tac-Toe) that it was getting burdensome to scroll through code, so I had to click through the preview menu, but knowing exactly where things where in their folders made this a lot easier and cleaner to build.
